This set of four tables holds the event counts from the Apollo 15 and 16
X-Ray Flourescence Spectrometers (XRFS) for all channels of the three
proportional counters (unfiltered, magnesium filter, aluminum filter)
and the solar monitor. The XRFS instruments were carried aboard the
Apollo 15 and 16 Command and Service Modules and took measurements from
lunar orbit.  They also had magnesium K alpha and Fe55 calibration
sources.  For more on the instrument, see:
http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1971-063A&ex=9 
These data were restored and made available as part of the Lunar Data 
Project at the National Space Science Data Center with assistance from 
Michael Bielefeld.  

The four tables are all in the same format, as described below.  The 
tables hold the following data:

A15C_XRFS_71_NORMAL_1.TAB
Data from the Apollo 15 XRFS set to normal modes [NFLAG = 14 or 96 as
described below] with all three counters measuring the same energy
ranges.

A15C_XRFS_71_EXTENDED_2.TAB 
Data from the Apollo 15 XRFS set to extended mode [NFLAG = 144 or 224 as
described below] with detector 1 (unfiltered) measuring with the energy
boundaries for each channel doubled.

A16C_XRFS_72_NORMAL_1.TAB
Data from the Apollo 16 XRFS set to normal modes [NFLAG = 14 or 96 as
described below] with all three counters measuring the same energy
ranges.

A16C_XRFS_72_EXTENDED_2.TAB 
Data from the Apollo 16 XRFS set to extended mode [NFLAG = 144 or 224 as
described below] with detector 1 (unfiltered) measuring with the energy
boundaries for each channel doubled.

The values give the measurement mode of the instrument, the time, orbit,
spacecraft position and orientation, and the event counts, normally for
8-second intervals, for the three proportional counters and the solar
monitor. The normal energy range for the first 7 channels of the first
three counters (detector 1 unfiltered, detector 2 magnesium filter, and
detector 3 aluminum filter) was between 0.75 and 2.75 keV, broken into
seven equal energy ranges: 0.75-1.04, 1.04-1.32, 1.32-1.61, 1.61-1.89,
1.89-2.18, 2.18-2.46, and 2.46-2.75 keV.  The solar monitor measured the
range from approximately 1 to 3 keV, divided into seven equal intervals.
An eighth channel recorded all x-ray events with energies higher than
the upper level.  However the solar monitor data for Apollo 15 was not 
usable due to saturation effects. 

Each row in the table represents one set of measurements and contains 45
numbers in the order: one integer (I3) designated NFLAG; eight real
numbers (F11.2,7F9.2) designated ANS(1) through ANS(8); and 36 integers
(36I6) forming an array designated ISPEC(I,J), where I ranges from 1
to 4 and represents the counter used, and J ranges from 1 to 9 and
represents the energy channel.

I=1 detector 1, beryllium windowed counter, no filter 
I=2 detector 2, beryllium windowed, magnesium filtered counter 
I=3 detector 3, beryllium windowed, aluminum filtered counter 
I=4 solar monitor 

J=1-7 seven energy regions into which the energy readings were divided, 
J=8 all x-ray events above the upper level discriminator 
J=9 all non X-ray events

The ISPEC values are ordered in each row as ISPEC(1,1), ISPEC(1,2), 
ISPEC(1,3), etc.

Specifically, the values in each row are:

(1) NFLAG [I3] - Measurement mode of the X-Ray Spectrometer, where:
NFLAG = 14 indicates normal mode, three detectors measuring external
input of energies above 0.75 keV, solar monitor measuring external input
above 1.0 keV.
NFLAG = 96 indicates calibration mode, the magnesium K alpha and Fe55 
calibration sources have been rotated into the field of view of detectors 
1, 2, and 3. 
NFLAG = 144 indicates same as normal mode except the energy range and 
all range boundaries for detector 1 channels have been doubled. 
NFLAG = 224 indicates same spectral range as NFLAG=144 but detectors 
1, 2, and 3 are measuring K alpha and Fe55 calibration sources.

(2) ANS(1) [F11.2] - Ground elapsed time in seconds (time since launch 
of Apollo 15 at 13:34:00 UT on 26 July 1971 or Apollo 16 at 17:54:00 UT

east from 180 to -180 at the midpoint of the accumulation period.
